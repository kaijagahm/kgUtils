# kgUtils

This package contains a few simple utility functions that I use fairly frequently.

"ownFunctions.R" contains self-written functions. "webFunctions.R" contains useful functions I found on the internet. Authors are credited for web functions.

### To use:
```
devtools::install_github("kaijagahm/kgUtils")
library(kgUtils)
```
